## What is that thing called Light
## Which I must never enjoy
---
## What are the blessings of the sight 
## O tell your poor blind boy! 
---
## You talk of wonderous things you see 
## You say the sun shines bright
---
## I feel him warm, but how can he 
## Or make it day or night? 
---
## My day or night myself I make 
## Whenever I sleep or play
---
## And could I ever keep awake 
## With me it were always day
---
## With heavy sighs I often hear 
## You mourn my hapless woe
---
## Then let not what I cannot have 
## My cheer of mind destroy 
---
## But sure with patience I can bear 
## A loss I never can know
---
## Whilst thus I sing, I am a king 
## Although a poor blind boy
---
## Can you help me to be the king in reality
## Can you be the guiding light for me
